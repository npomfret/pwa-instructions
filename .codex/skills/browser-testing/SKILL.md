## Browser testing

Use these conventions for browser-driven tests, including Playwright component tests and Vitest browser mode. Shared rules and platform notes use the same numbers.

### Shared UI testing rules

Tests describe user behavior through page objects. Keep navigation and element knowledge in those objects so UI changes have one place to update.

1. **Page objects own the screen.** Tests arrange data/stubs, call page-object methods and assert returned values. Element lookup, actions, reads and UI assertions stay inside shared page-object classes, including modals and common regions.
2. **Locate by what a person perceives.** Start at a recognisable section, dialog or row, then narrow by role, accessible name, label or visible source-locale text. Write source text literally. Fix missing interface labels rather than navigating DOM/tree internals. A lookup must identify exactly one element: no first/last/nth selection. Check lists as a whole. Test-only identifiers need a page-object-local comment explaining why perceivable lookup cannot work. Build fresh queries, not cached values from the screen.
3. **Poll for change.** Every result check, including absence, retries until its expected state or named timeout. Fixed delays are not allowed.
4. **Avoid snapshot decisions.** Do not branch on a one-off element read or assert it with plain equality. One-off reads are only for diagnostics after a polling assertion fails. Assert user-visible behavior, focus, semantic states and requests, not styling, application internals or element-tree snapshots.
5. **Actions verify their effect.** Check visibility/enabled state, perform the action, wait for its result and return the already-verified page object for the destination. A modal closing waits for closure; a save waits for visible confirmation/change. Each starting screen has a static entry point or fixture that opens and verifies it; tests do not construct page objects. Constructors do not wait. Each object has `verifyLoaded()` for its own landmarks. Name methods by their outcome; an action staying on the same screen may return nothing.
6. **Prove the transition.** Assert the relevant old state before an action as well as the new state after it, so leftover data or a no-op cannot pass.
7. **Use real input.** Do not force actions, call handlers to bypass UI, or retry submits/creates/deletes. Fix missed input in the app. While a fix is pending, only an idempotent action/assertion pair may be retried.
8. **Fail at the first wrong state.** Page objects check their screen before steps, old/new field values around edits, validation state before submission, and destination landmarks after navigation. Poll these checks; failures say what was actually visible and where. Keep named timeout constants together; increasing a limit is not a timing fix.
9. **Stub external boundaries.** Use typed/validated builders and install network/system-service stubs before navigation or launch. Do not mock project components, hooks or view models. A mid-test server change replaces the stub, triggers the real update event and waits for the UI result.
10. **Treat flakiness as failure.** Disable automatic retries. After a timing fix, repeat the affected test (normally 20 times) and report the pass count.

### Departures

Rules 3, 4 and 7 have no exceptions. Other departures need a comment naming the rule, the concrete constraint and what would remove it. The single-match requirement in rule 2 also has no exception.

### On the web

1. **Tests never touch the page.**
   - Every page, modal, dialog, dropdown and shared region (header, footer, toasts) has one page-object class.
   - Forbidden in a test file:
     - any selector, and any `Locator`
     - `page.locator`, `page.getBy…`, `page.$`, `page.$$`, `page.evaluate`
     - acting on an element: `click`, `fill`, `type`, `press`, `check`, `selectOption`, `hover`, `page.keyboard`, `page.mouse`
     - reading an element: `textContent`, `innerText`, `inputValue`, `getAttribute`, `isVisible`, `count`
     - `expect(locator)` in any form
   - A test may also assert the URL, with `expect(page).toHaveURL()`.

2. **Find elements by narrowing.**
   - A locator starts at a container a person would recognise, then narrows inside it:

     ```ts
     // the "Rent" expense, inside the "Expenses" section, then its Delete button
     this.page.getByRole('region', { name: 'Expenses' })
       .getByRole('listitem').filter({ hasText: 'Rent' })
       .getByRole('button', { name: 'Delete' })

     // a dialog by its title, then a field by its label
     this.page.getByRole('dialog', { name: 'Edit group' }).getByLabel('Group name')

     // a section with no landmark role, found by the heading inside it
     this.page.getByRole('article').filter({ has: this.page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Balances' }) })
     ```
   - Each step uses, in this order:
     1. role and accessible name: `getByRole`
     2. label text: `getByLabel`
     3. placeholder: `getByPlaceholder`
     4. visible text: `getByText`, `filter({ hasText })`
     5. alt text: `getByAltText`
   - An icon-only control is found by its accessible name, which is also its tooltip: `getByRole('button', { name: 'Delete' })`.
   - A section with a heading but no name is fixed in the markup, for example with a `<section aria-labelledby>` for that heading.
   - Never use CSS selectors, class names, ids, other HTML attributes, XPath or DOM structure (`locator('..')`, child combinators).
   - **Never use `first()`, `last()` or `nth()`.** Playwright refuses to act on or assert against a locator that matches several elements (a strict mode violation). That error is the ambiguity rule 2 describes, and `first()` is how it gets silenced.
   - A list is checked whole: `expect(rows).toHaveCount(3)`, or `expect(rows).toHaveText(['Food', 'Rent', 'Travel'])` when order matters.
   - A `data-testid` is allowed only inside a page object, with the comment rule 2 asks for.
   - Each locator is a protected method on the page object that builds a fresh `Locator` every time it is called. Never keep an element handle, a text value, a count or an `isVisible()` result.

3. **Poll with retrying assertions.**
   - `waitForTimeout`, `sleep`, a `setTimeout` promise and `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` are forbidden, with no exceptions.
   - Wait with assertions that retry: `expect(locator).toBeVisible()`, `toHaveText()`, `toHaveValue()`, `toBeEnabled()`, `toBeFocused()`, `toHaveURL()`.
   - "Gone" is `not.toBeVisible()` or `toHaveCount(0)`.
   - For a value that is not on a locator, use `expect.poll()`.

4. **Snapshot reads.**
   - `isVisible()`, `count()`, `textContent()`, `inputValue()` and `allTextContents()` are one-off reads. Never branch on one, and never assert one with a plain `expect(value)`.
   - Never assert class names, computed styles or markup snapshots.

5. **Hand over the next page object.**
   - A click that navigates waits for the URL and for the destination's `verifyLoaded()`, then returns the destination's page object.
   - Tests never construct a page object with `new`. The entry point is a static `navigateTo(page)`, or a fixture built on it, which goes to the page, verifies it and returns its page object:

     ```ts
     const login = await LoginPage.navigateTo(page)
     const dashboard = await login.loginAndOpenDashboard(email, password)
     const group = await dashboard.openGroup('Flat 3')
     const expense = await group.clickAddExpenseAndOpenForm()
     ```
   - `verifyLoaded()` asserts the URL as well as the landmarks only that page shows.

7. **Never force.**
   - Act through real browser events: `click`, `fill`, `hover`, `press`, tabbing.
   - `force: true` and `dispatchEvent` are forbidden. They skip Playwright's actionability checks.
   - While a fix is pending, an idempotent pair may be retried with `expect(async () => { … }).toPass()`. Never wrap a submit, create or delete in `toPass`.

8. **Sanity checks.**
   - wl-bill-splitter's `ExpenseFormPage.sanityCheck()` is the pattern: it asserts the form is still open before each step.
   - A check that fails catches the assertion error and rethrows one that says what the page showed, with the current URL when it matters.

9. **Stub at the network.**
   - Replace the API at the request boundary, with Mock Service Worker handlers or Playwright's `page.route`.
   - Register stubs before navigation.

10. **Flaky is failing.**
    - Run with `retries: 0`.
    - After a timing fix, run with `--repeat-each=20` and report the count that passed.
